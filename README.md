# Architex - Solution Architect Support Platform

A comprehensive AI-powered platform designed to support solution architects throughout the entire solution architecture lifecycle, from business problem analysis to implementation guidance.

## ðŸš€ Vision

Architex transforms how solution architects work by providing an integrated platform that combines intelligent workbench capabilities, knowledge management, AI assistance, and real-time collaboration.

## Architecture Overview

The platform is built as a microservices architecture on Azure with the following components:

```
solution-architect-platform/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/                    # React-based Solution Architect Workbench
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api-gateway/            # FastAPI-based API Gateway
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ai-oracle/              # AI/ML services (NLP, Knowledge Graph, Generative AI)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ knowledge-hub/          # Neo4j-based knowledge management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ collaboration-engine/   # Real-time collaboration services
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ integration-layer/      # External system integrations
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/             # Azure infrastructure as code
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/                     # Shared libraries and utilities
â””â”€â”€ docs/                      # Documentation
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+
- Docker
- Azure CLI

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables
3. Start the development environment:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Start frontend development server
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Start individual backend services
cd services/api-gateway && python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Development Workflow

Each microservice is designed to be independently deployable with its own:
- Dockerfile for containerization
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Health checks and monitoring
- API documentation
